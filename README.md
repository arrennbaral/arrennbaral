Iâ€™m a QA Engineer with four years of experience in software testing and automation. I specialize in building scalable test automation frameworks that improve efficiency and software quality. I have hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven, and Git, developing automation solutions that reduce manual testing efforts and enhance software reliability.

Iâ€™ve worked with CI/CD tools like Jenkins to integrate testing into the development lifecycle, ensuring smooth deployments and continuous software delivery. I focus on debugging and optimizing test scripts, always looking for ways to improve performance and reliability.

I enjoy working in Agile environments, designing and executing detailed test scenarios to ensure thorough coverage. Staying up to date with the latest automation tools and best practices is important to me, and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve testing efficiency.
